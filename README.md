*** TO BE UPDATED/EDITED by deadline **** 

In my 'Tipster app', I spent a couple hours working on implementing the basic features of a tip calculator. 

This included: 
- the implementation of features that calculated the amount of tip required given a a bill given, 
- the implementation of features that involved animation 
- special graphics
